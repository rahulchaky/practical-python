## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python
programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and
program organization. By the end of this course, students should be
able to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able
to understand and modify Python code written by their
coworkers.
