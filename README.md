## What is This?

This repo is my work from the Practical Python Programming Course by dabaez.
[Link to the course](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/)

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python
programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and
program organization. By the end of this course, students should be
able to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able
to understand and modify Python code written by their
coworkers.

## Requirements

To complete this course, you need nothing more than a basic
installation of Python 3.6 or newer and time to work on it.
