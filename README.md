## What is This?

The material you see here is the heart of an instructor-led Python
training course used for corporate training and professional
development. It has been in continual development since 2007 and
battle tested in real-world classrooms.  Usually, it's taught
in-person over the span of three or four days--requiring approximately
25-35 hours of intense work. This includes the completion of
approximately 130 hands-on coding exercises.

## Target Audience

Students of this course are usually professional scientists,
engineers, and programmers who already have experience in at least one
other programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is required,
but knowledge of common programming topics is assumed.  Most
participants find the course challenging--even if they've already been
doing a bit of Python programming.

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python
programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and
program organization.  By the end of this course, students should be
able to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able
to understand and modify Python code written by their
coworkers.

## Requirements

To complete this course, you need nothing more than a basic
installation of Python 3.6 or newer and time to work on it.
